Come with it now!
Come with it now!

The microphone explodes, shattering the molds
Either drop hits like De-La-O or get the fuck off the commode
With the sure shot, sure to make your bodies drop
Drop and don't copy yo, don't call this a co-op
Terror rains drenchin', quenchin' the thirst of the power dons
That five sided fist-a-gon
The rotten sore on the face of mother earth gets bigger
Triggers cold empty your purse

They rally 'round the family, with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family, with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family, with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family, with a pocket full of shells

Weapons not food, not homes, not shoes
Not need, just feed the war cannibal animal
I walk the corner to the rubble that used to be a library
Lined up to the mind cemetery now
What we don't know keeps the contracts alive an movin'
They don't gotta burn the books they just remove 'em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells

Rally 'round the family, pockets full of shells
Rally 'round the family, with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family, with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family, with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family, with a pocket full of shells

The bulls on parade

Come with it now
Come with it now
Bulls on parade

The bulls on parade
The bulls on parade
The bulls on parade
The bulls on parade
